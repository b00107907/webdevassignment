			<h2>Why Ride?</h2>
			<p>There are as many reasons to ride a motorcycle, scooter or moped as there are motorcyclists. Here's a very short list of the reasons why.</p>
			<hr>
			<img src="images/why_bike.jpg" alt="motorcycles parked in secnic area" id="s1whyimg">
			<p><strong><em>Riding is fun!</em></strong> Sounds deceptively simple, but the fact is riding a powered two wheeler is fun. Most riders ride solely for pleasure. Biking gives you a sense of freedom and exhilaration that nothing else can match.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Riding leaves you alert and energized.</em></strong> If you're into your gym training you'll get this one. Biking does something similar, only better. If you arrive at work half asleep from sitting for ages in traffic, this is a good reason to make the switch.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Riding is less stressful than driving.</em></strong> Or public transport for that matter. Studies have shown regular motorcycle commuters have less stress than car drivers because they have greater control of their travel times.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Riding is life.</em></strong> You watch the world from the inside of a car, but you experience the world from the seat of a motorcycle.</p>

			<h2>Go Touring</h2>
			<img src="images/why_img2.jpg" alt="secnic coastal picture" id="s2whyimg">
			<p>We're fortunate enough to live on a small island on the edge of the Atlantic which happens to have some of the best scenery anywhere in the world.</p>
			<p>We may be blas&eacute; about it but people pay good money to come from all over the world just to experience the unique character and culture of our landscape.</p>
			<p>Yes, you could drive, but then you'd miss out on the sounds and smells that so enhance the experience you have when you ride a motorcycle.</p>
			<p>Moreover, when you park up your motorcycle it'll often draw the attention of the curious onlooker or the knowledgeable local and you'll generally find people will come up to you and chat. Try that with your hire car!</p>
			<p>There is quite simply no better way to open up new perspectives on the country we live in, or simply escape the daily grind than to take a day or more and just tour on a motorcycle.</p>
