			<h2>How to Buy</h2>
			<p>It all comes down to buying privately or via a dealer. As this site is aimed at the novice, or someone who doesn't yet own a bike, I would strongly recommend a reputable dealer.</p>
			<p>That said, buying privately may be an option if you know (and trust) the seller and you are sure that the bike they're selling suits your requirements and license.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>What sort of bike?</h2>
			<p>If you're new to all of this and would like to get a bike, it helps to know what sort or style of bike you like.</p>
			<p>Remember also that your choices will be limited by your age and license category. If you're lucky enough to be between the ages of 16 and 18 for example, you are limited to a 125cc motorcycle.</p>

			<h2>Buying Advice</h2>
			<p>If buying privately you need to know the bike and the market. This is fine if you're experienced, but if not you need a knowledgeable friend or else stick to the reputable dealerships. It's in the dealers interest to build a long term business relationship with you.</p>
			<p>Do your homework - Read as much as you can about the bike you're interested in. Owner's forums, online magazines, clubs, etc. can all be very useful sources of information. Know the different model options for your target bike.</p>
			<p>Never inspect a prospective purchase in rain or artificial light. You need to see the machine in daylight.</p>
