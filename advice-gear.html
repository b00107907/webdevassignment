			<h2>Getting it Right</h2>
			<p><strong>Buying the right gear is crucial to your enjoyment of motorcycling. Here's how to get it right from the top down.</strong></p>
			<hr>
			<img src="images/helmet.jpg" alt="motorcycle helmet image" class="gear_left_img">
			<h2>Helmet</h2>
			<p>The single most important item, <em>and the only one you are legally required to buy.</em><br>
			It's also one of the most expensive items of equipment with prices from &euro;150 to over &euro;600 or more.</p>
			<p><strong>A good helmet</strong> should be considered an investment rather than a stress purchase, and will typically last for about five years.</p>
			<p>There are a number of varieties on the market. In general, aim to get a <strong>full face</strong> helmet as the open face types are not suitable in the Irish climate and provide less protection in the event of an accident.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Know this:</em></strong> Although a compulsory piece of safety equipment, helmets are subject to VAT in Ireland at the "luxury" rate of 23%. This significantly adds to the cost. North of the border the VAT rate on helmets is zero.</p>

			<h2>Did you know?</h2>
			<p>Ladies are well catered for with all the top motorcycle clothing manufacturers now offering a full range of specially designed ladies motorcycle clothing. In recent years, the market has expanded further to include multi-purpose clothing which can be worn on and off the bike.</p>

			<h2>Jacket</h2>
			<img src="images/jacket.jpg" alt="motorcycle jacket image" class="gear_right_img">
			<p><strong>A good jacket</strong> serves many purposes. First and most importantly it has to keep the weather at bay. It has to offer abrasion and impact protection in the event of a spill, and it has to be comfortable.</p>
			<p>There's a huge range on offer from the traditional "biker" leather jacket to modern high tech textiles.</p>
			<p>In general, a good quality textile jacket offers the most versatile solution. It should be waterproof but breathable and have removable thermal linings. It should be a snug fit without being overly tight.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Know this:</em></strong> Jackets will have armour panels which must be CE Approved.<br> Most will have a basic back protector panel included, but you can buy more sophisticated protection separately.</p>
			<p>At a minimum, a jacket should have elbow, shoulder and back protection. Some also incorporate kidney or chest protection, and some even have airbags!</p>
			<p>If you decide to buy leather, remember it's not waterproof! It's a good idea to buy a lightweight rain jacket &amp; trousers you can wear over leathers.</p>
			<hr>

			<img src="images/glove.jpg" alt="motorcycle glove image" class="gear_left_img">
			<h2>Gloves</h2>
			<p>What's the first thing you do if you fall?<br>
			You put your hands out to brace the impact and protect yourself.</p>
			<p><strong>Good gloves</strong> are an essential component. They keep your hands warm and dry. They provide protection from abrasion in the event of a fall, but must be flexible enough to allow finesse on the controls.</p>
			<p>Look for composite types which combine leather, textiles and armour protection to best effect. In general touring gloves or summer gloves are a good bet. Avoid "racing" gloves or anything too bulky.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Know this:</em></strong> Wet hands will get cold very rapidly at road speeds even if the ambient temperature is not that low. Cold hands impair concentration and make it difficult to work the controls. Always aim to get gloves which have a waterproof breathable membrane like Gore-Tex or Shell-Tex incorporated into the glove itself.</p>
			<hr>

		<section>
			<h2>Trousers</h2>
			<img src="images/trousers.jpg" alt="motorcycle trouser image" class="gear_right_img">
			<p><strong>Motorcycle trousers</strong> are generally of similar construction to the jacket and can be made of leather, advanced textiles, or a mixture of both.</p>
			<p>As with jackets, trousers should have CE Approved armour protection to the knees, hips and optionally the shins.</p>
			<p>In general, it's a good idea for a novice to get a matching jacket &amp; trousers as as suit because these can be zipped together for better protection.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Know this:</em></strong> Trousers can be worn over your normal attire or instead of your normal attire. There are a number of products on the market designed to look like "normal" clothing which incorporate the abrasion and impact resistance of proper motorcycle clothing without looking like "biker gear".</p>
			<p>If possible, try to buy a jacket and trouser combo as a matching set, ideally by the same manufacturer. It's usually less expensive this way.</p>

			<img src="images/boots.jpg" alt="motorcycle boots image" class="gear_left_img">
			<h2>Boots</h2>
			<p>Good motorcycle boots need to be comfortable to wear, but provide suitable protection from weather, abrasion and impact.</p>
			<p><strong>Weather protection</strong> is critical because feet are often the most exposed to the elements while riding. Like gloves, boots must provide protection from abrasion in the event of a fall, but must be flexible enough to allow finesse on the controls.</p>
			<p>Typically made of leather combined with advanced synthetics a good boot will provide CE Approved protection to the shin, ankle and foot yet be comfortable enough to wear all day on or off the bike.</p>
			<p><strong><em>Know this:</em></strong> Racing or motocross style boots are not ideal for general purpose use being overly restrictive when worn off the bike. Cheap non branded boots often don't have CE Approved armour and are best avoided.<br>Touring style boots are a good all-round option for commuter and general purpose use.</p>
			<hr>
		</section>

		<aside class="didyouknow">
			<h2>Did you know?</h2>
			<p>When riding, gloves can get wet despite the best efforts of the rider so it's a good idea to own and carry a second pair. Commuter riders often supplement their riding gear with a rain suit for use in extremely wet conditions.</p>
