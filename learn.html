			<h2>Learn to Ride</h2>
			<p><strong>So you want to ride a motorcycle, and you're not sure where to start?</strong></p>
			<p>Well you've come to the right place and getting started is far easier than you might think.</p>
			<p>The basic steps are these:</p>
			<ol id="learnlist">
				<li>Do the driver theory test</li>
				<li>Obtain your learner permit</li>
				<li>Complete your <em>Initial Basic Training</em> with an RSA approved instructor</li>
				<li>Apply for and undertake the practical test</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you've passed the practical test you can ride any motorcycle or trike. Most experienced riders would recommend advanced rider training (post-test training) for new riders on larger capacity motorcycles.</p>
		</section>

		<aside class="didyouknow">
			<h2>Did you know?</h2>
			<p>There are four motorcycle license categories. Anyone who is 24 years or over should apply in category A. This means that when you pass your test, you will be licensed to ride any motorcycle.</p>
		</aside>

		<section>
			<h2>Younger Riders</h2>
			<p>EU wide changes introduced in 2013 imposed certain restrictions on younger riders and lowered the age you can start to 16. If you are between the ages of 16 and 23 you should consult an RSA Approved Riding Instructor to discuss your options. You can find a list of RSA Approved instructors on the RSA web site <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>About Initial Basic Training</h2>
			<p>Initial Basic Training (IBT) is a mandatory training course lasting approximately 16 hours over 4 modules. It teaches basic riding skills to learner motorcyclists in a safe and structured way. On completion of the IBT course the learner rider can ride unaccompanied on the road while gaining practical experience for the test.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Advanced Training</h2>
			<p>A high proportion of Motorcyclists go on to take advanced (post test) training. At the most basic level, this consists of structured assessments which can reduce the cost of insurance for riders returning to motorcycling after a long absence. Beyond this there are programs offered by <a href="https://www.rospa.com/safety-training/on-road/advanced/">RoSPA</a> and the <a href="https://www.iamroadsmart.com/" target="_blank">IAM</a> which aim to bring riders up to the highest available civilian standards.</p>
		</section>

		<aside class="didyouknow">
			<h2>Fast track</h2>
			<p>The quickest way to get started is to talk to an approved instructor today. It won't cost you any more than a phone call. Find your nearest approved instructor on the RSA web site <a href="http://www.rsa.ie/en/RSA/Learner-Drivers/Finding-an-instructor/" target="_blank">here</a>. Look for an instructor in Category A.</p>
		</aside>

		<section>
			<h2>What next?</h2>
			<p>Don't say <em>&quot;One day I'll do that...&quot;</em> because there has never been a better time to start than today! In under a year from now you'll be wondering why you didn't do it sooner. Take the plunge and enjoy the journey!</p>
